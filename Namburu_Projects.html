         <h2>The Celebration</h2>
   <h5 class="thumbnail">
   <div class="Col-sm-4">
This was the first project I got to design in CSE. For this project my partner and I were assigned to create a game or a story about anything we wanted to do.Before we got into this project we learned some basic knowledge about how to write code in scratch. Once the whole class was finished with the practice, our teacher assigned us partners so that we could get right to work. We had a choice about starting from scratch or building upon a game/story that already exists. My partner and I decided to do a story from scratch with a fantasy storyline with user interaction. The objective of the story is for the prince to get back to the princess to save her on time. My role in this project is to create code for the characters such as how they interact with one another. As I continued to work on this project I learned how to write code for different characters when they come to a point where they must talk to one another. I also learnd about the various variables involved in the coding. Some challenges I came upon while doing this project were that there were bugs that caused the game to fall apart. My partner and I had to go back and look through the entire code to see where we went wrong. Once we figured out the bug we were able to fix it. Some skills I obtained at the end of the project was that I was able successfully code in scratch and I learned how to use user interaction for stories to make them more interesting. </br>

     <h2>Image Manipulation Project</h2>
   <h5 class="thumbnail">
   <div class="Col-sm-4">
This was the hardest project I had  to design in CSE. The project required for me to take time outside 
of class to figure out how to write the code so there are no faults in it. For this project my partner and I were assigned to 
create code that would apply to a group of images at once. We had to write the code so that it would take the images in a 
folder and modify them the way we want it. In our code, the code takes the images and adds two borders of different sizes 
and tilts the pictures sideways. We had a choice of picking what the topic our manipulations are going to be on, by picking
clients. My partner and I picked client 2  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16n_ncZVh0Jj8QCa2RRBlmAaJWWFbe-1TvUsMSlxpsYM/edit" target="_blank"> (1.4.7 Image Artist)</a>, which is a family. They wanted something simple but nice to highlight family and
individual members. Before we got into this project we learned some basic knowledge about how to do image manipulations.
We started small by adding small changes to images given to us by our teacher. We learned how to use different functions to get the manipulations we want. 
Once, the project was assigned, we needed to brainstorm ideas of what we wanted the manipulations to be. We wanted to
start small and get simple manipulations done within the time given to us. We decided that it would be easier for us to build upon 
Mr.Brown’s  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qVtdKMd64hmEHq2-yMWw4zpplfDhE9uzGtQCMBgczHc/edit" target="_blank"> 1.4.5 code.</a> Since the code he gave already iterates to every image in the folder, all we had to do was add
the functions for the manipulations we desired.  My role in this project was to write the code for adding borders around 
the picture. It took me a long time but I learned to build my code by using my teacher’s code as a model. As I continued to work on this
project I learned how to write for loops to iterate my code all at once. I also learned about the various variables involved in python 
image manipulation. Some challenges I came upon while doing this project were that I did not have enough time to add the geometric shapes
required by my client. My partner and I had to settle for the manipulations we created so far. Some skills I obtained at the end of the project was 
that I was able successfully to manipulate images no matter how many there are.<br/>

      To build a prototype of a car that is able to run on different energy sources. We had to be able to try different combinations of energy sources such as 1 hydrogen fuel cell, 2 hydrogen fuel cells, 1 solar cell, or 2 solar cells .

     <h2>Solar Sisters</h2>
   <h5 class="thumbnail">
   <div class="Col-sm-4">
     
      For this project the given task was that Tesla Motors was investigating the use of solar and hydrogen cell to power their cars. The company wanted to gain some insight on the amount of power and speed capabilities of these sources to support their designs. In a group of four, my team and were instructed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rg_LW-VsEeTNoiB3OEgwSa1Mz7NgUm2taHU12W-xaoY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> (1.3.2 Instructions)</a>
     to design, create, and test a prototype of a car that uses a solar module and/or hydrogen fuel cell as its power source. We had to use different combinations of energy sources such as 1 hydrogen fuel cell, 2 hydrogen fuel cells in a parallel or series circuit, 1 solar cell, and 2 solar cells in a parallel or series circuit to see which configuration had the best results in time and efficiency. As a team we built a two level vehicle that can potentially hold two solar cells along with two hydrogen cells. As we tested out our different configurations we realized that our prototype works best with two solar cells compared to any other configurations. In our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kc8hcEWBXN2Nck5b_rZH3MLB0nt3QZ_3d3KcbSPAJls/edit" target="_blank"> Documentation</a>
we noted all the changes and results of our different power configurations such as the efficiency of each type energy source. In this project my role was to build the compartments on the vehicle so that the solar and hydrogen cells will not just be placed on the vehicle but be mechanically built in. I was also incharge of working on the calculations of each power source and coming to a conclusion of which source was the best. As I worked on this project I learned more about the difficulties using renewable sources for a long period of time. Both solar cells and hydrogen cells have both pros and cons to them. Solar cells might generally be more efficient than hydrogen cells but the problem with them are that they do not store energy from the UV light and as a result they fail to work without a constant power source. Hydrogen cells do store energy in them but have to constantly be charged and work at a very slow pace. Some challenges with this project was with the hydrogen cells which sometimes worked but other times took quite a long time to even move. My group and I tried to make the efficient of the hydrogen cell improve but were unable to do so within our deadline. Overall, with this project I learned to use two different energy sources to power a vehicle.

     <h2>West Point Bridge Design</h2>
   <h5 class="thumbnail">
   <div class="Col-sm-4">
     In this project, my partner and I had to create a stable bridge for the American Bridge company while still keeping the design within the budget and following the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C2c51ND_ZWWbdeJ4GioGDLqnFg8A415hKEV64FwbMZw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> constraints</a>. Each of us had to create the two designs using materials such as carbon steel, high-strength low-alloy steel, or quenched along with a cross section of the solid or hollow bar. For my first design, I used the Pratt truss design made of carbon steel with a cross-section of a solid bar. The size of each truss varies between 130mm to 150mm. The cost of this truss was $299.597.72 which was under the budget of $300,000. However, this bridge was not very stable since every time a truck went over it bends inwards a little too much. The second design was a Howe Truss design made of high strength low alloy with the cross section of Hollow tube. The size of each truss varies between 140mm to 220mm. The cost was a little more expensive than my first one since it was around $299,870.52. This bridge was much more stable than the first one since it was much secured and bent very little with the  weight of the truck over it. To finalize which bridge to use, we created a table in our 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13b3l9bgC7DqPeNnQCA9-YxBdLMDVzWbIGSNdfHXClUc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Documentation</a> that compares all four designs in different aspects such as cost, secureness, movement, and compression/tension. Once we finished our designing and finalizing I worked on the decision matrix and research summary. The decision matrix is a paragraph about why we chose that bridge which could be backed up by the table. Through the research summary, it was found that most bridge designs are Pratt and Howe in which the Pratt is the best choice for it covered more distance. Through this project, I learned the different types of bridge designs there are and how materials and sizes determine the effectiveness of a bridge.
