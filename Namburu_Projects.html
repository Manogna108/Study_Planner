   <h5 class="thumbnail">
This was the first project I got to design in CSE. For this project my partner and I were assigned to create a game or a story about anything we wanted to do.Before we got into this project we learned some basic knowledge about how to write code in scratch. Once the whole class was finished with the practice, our teacher assigned us partners so that we could get right to work. We had a choice about starting from scratch or building upon a game/story that already exists. My partner and I decided to do a story from scratch with a fantasy storyline with user interaction. The objective of the story is for the prince to get back to the princess to save her on time. My role in this project is to create code for the characters such as how they interact with one another. As I continued to work on this project I learned how to write code for different characters when they come to a point where they must talk to one another. I also learnd about the various variables involved in the coding. Some challenges I came upon while doing this project were that there were bugs that caused the game to fall apart. My partner and I had to go back and look through the entire code to see where we went wrong. Once we figured out the bug we were able to fix it. Some skills I obtained at the end of the project was that I was able successfully code in scratch and I learned how to use user interaction for stories to make them more interesting.
