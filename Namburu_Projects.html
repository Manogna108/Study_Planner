         <h2>The Celebration</h2>
   <h5 class="thumbnail">
   <div class="Col-sm-4">
This was the first project I got to design in CSE. For this project my partner and I were assigned to create a game or a story about anything we wanted to do.Before we got into this project we learned some basic knowledge about how to write code in scratch. Once the whole class was finished with the practice, our teacher assigned us partners so that we could get right to work. We had a choice about starting from scratch or building upon a game/story that already exists. My partner and I decided to do a story from scratch with a fantasy storyline with user interaction. The objective of the story is for the prince to get back to the princess to save her on time. My role in this project is to create code for the characters such as how they interact with one another. As I continued to work on this project I learned how to write code for different characters when they come to a point where they must talk to one another. I also learnd about the various variables involved in the coding. Some challenges I came upon while doing this project were that there were bugs that caused the game to fall apart. My partner and I had to go back and look through the entire code to see where we went wrong. Once we figured out the bug we were able to fix it. Some skills I obtained at the end of the project was that I was able successfully code in scratch and I learned how to use user interaction for stories to make them more interesting. </br>

     <h2>Image Manipulation Project</h2>
   <h5 class="thumbnail">
   <div class="Col-sm-4">
This was the hardest project I had  to design in CSE. The project required for me to take time outside 
of class to figure out how to write the code so there are no faults in it. For this project my partner and I were assigned to 
create code that would apply to a group of images at once. We had to write the code so that it would take the images in a 
folder and modify them the way we want it. In our code, the code takes the images and adds two borders of different sizes 
and tilts the pictures sideways. We had a choice of picking what the topic our manipulations are going to be on, by picking
clients. My partner and I picked client 2  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g919kguNczub1LxhojTfSCugJ-o8HiE33m9lY2A0l80/edit" target="_blank"> (1.4.7 Image Artist)</a>, which is a family. They wanted something simple but nice to highlight family and
individual members. Before we got into this project we learned some basic knowledge about how to do image manipulations.
We started small by adding small changes to images given to us by our teacher. We learned how to use different functions to get the manipulations we want. 
Once, the project was assigned, we needed to brainstorm ideas of what we wanted the manipulations to be. We wanted to
start small and get simple manipulations done within the time given to us. We decided that it would be easier for us to build upon 
Mr.Brown’s  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/145VIA-jjmW_M3prqBU8t0UFSWo2soHEB6s0ANFCFV7s/edit" target="_blank"> 1.4.5 code.</a> Since the code he gave already iterates to every image in the folder, all we had to do was add
the functions for the manipulations we desired.  My role in this project was to write the code for adding borders around 
the picture. It took me a long time but I learned to build my code by using my teacher’s code as a model. As I continued to work on this
project I learned how to write for loops to iterate my code all at once. I also learned about the various variables involved in python 
image manipulation. Some challenges I came upon while doing this project were that I did not have enough time to add the geometric shapes
required by my client. My partner and I had to settle for the manipulations we created so far. Some skills I obtained at the end of the project was 
that I was able successfully to manipulate images no matter how many there are.<br/>
