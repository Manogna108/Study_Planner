                On this page are the field trips and influential guest speakers that I have experienced in the past four years. They helped me learn more about what I would be learning and doing to reach my future goal. Here is the link to my resume.

            <h3>Stanford University and the Museum of Computer Science 11/14/18</h3>
            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="padding:20px">
                Through this field trip, I was allowed to experience a tour of a university and later explore the Museum of Computer Science. Stanford University was a large campus with many engineering related courses. We got a tour between the engineering buildings such as mechanical engineering and computer science building. Though our tour guide was not in the engineering field she explained that many engineering fields have a high number of graduates each year. As my future goal being a computer science engineer, exploring a college with so much engineering background was helpful. Next, we went to the Museum of Computer Science where we looked at the historical background of computer science. We looked at the original computers and the original virtual games. Not only relating to computer science we also saw many artifacts related to hardware engineering such as how the computer was manufactured. Overall, the museum was a good experience for me to see how computer science gradually advanced to what we have today.

            <h3>Maynand Holiday 10/15/18</h3>

            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="padding:20px">
                This influential speaker talked about how they are a mechanical engineer that works with a team that map and sample radioactive hazardous rooms. To do this they would need to build a robot that would go and scan the rooms so that no human would get exposed to the radiation. During the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, safety measurements failed and a reactor exploded releasing toxic materials onto the world. The radiation spread around the area and caused cancer and other forms of diseases. The main job for Holiday was to build this robot that could to identify areas in the building with gamma radiation and toxic fog. Once it identifies the radiation, it is programmed to take samples to bring back for further testing. Later they talked about AI such as what do they do and how well have we developed some. I was interested in how Al was programmed to do certain tasks and machine learning. Though the speaker did not go into how they were programmed it was interesting to know that the technology we use every day such as Siri, fingerprint ID, and face ID is all part of machine learning. The speaker made me think about maybe in the future I could work for a company that creates or improves AI or more specifically machine learning.
