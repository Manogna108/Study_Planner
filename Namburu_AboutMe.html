My name is Manogna Namburu and I am a student at Dublin High School. My initial goal in life is to become a computer software engineer. After spending quite some time coding in my computer science class last year I realized that I am interested in learning about how to use different languages so that I am able to build more complex projects in the future. Another main reason behind my profound interest is that both my parents are computer science engineers and so I hope that someday I would get the chance to follow in their footsteps. My plans to achieve this goal is to continue in the computer engineering academy at my high school so that I would get exposed to not only computer science but other fields related to engineering. Though my heart is set on computer science engineering, I might end up loving another field. Finally, once I am in college I would like to receive a degree in computer science engineering.

                                   <h5 class="thumbnail"> I am generally seen as a person who works hard to reach her goals and does not give up on the way because the workload is too much. Even at school projects I am seen to be self-motivated to get the work done on time. I personally believe that I would be a good computer engineer since I possess characteristics such as being alert at all times, organized and finally I am persistent, once I get engaged in some activity, I do not back out. In high school, some major accomplishments I have done so far are balancing my classes so that I get the work done on time and still do an admirable job on it. I am proud to have learned that I am able to handle any large amount of work given to me so far. Last year, I decided to take a bold decision and take computer science as my elective. I know that the class might be a challenge for me since up till then I have never had any experiences in computer coding or was familiar with the languages taught in that class. Though it was tough at first I learned to cope with the workload and enjoy what I am learning. Similarly, this year in POE, I faced similar challenges as last year. I had no experience in the physical aspects of mechanical engineering projects which caused me to worry if I would do well in this class. After doing more than three projects this semester, I adapted to the criteria of this class and find projects no longer a hassle.
