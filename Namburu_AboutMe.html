My name is Manogna Namburu and I am a student at Dublin High School. My initial goal in life is to become a computer software engineer. After spending quite some time coding in my computer science class I realized that I am interested in learning about how to use different languages so that I am able to build more complex projects in the future. Another main reason behind my profound interest is that both my parents are computer science engineers and so I hope that someday I would get the chance to follow in their footsteps. My plans to achieve this goal is to first participate in the computer engineering academy at my highschool so that I would get some basic knowledge of  programming languages. Finally, once I am in college I would like to receive a degree in computer science engineering.

                               <h5 class="thumbnail"> I am generally seen as a person who works hard to reach her goals and does not give on the way because the workload is too much. Even at school projects I am seen to be self-motivated to get the work done on time. I personally believe that I would be a good computer engineer since I possess  characteristics such as being alert at all times, organized and finally I am persistent since once I get engaged in some activity, I do not back out. In high school, some major accomplishments I have done so far are balancing my classes so that I get the work done on time and still do an admirable job on it. I am proud to have learned that I am able to handle any large amount of work given to me so far. This year, I decided to take a bold decision and take computer science as my elective. I know that the class might be a challenge for me since up till now I have never had any experiences in computer coding or was familiar with the languages taught in this class. After being in this class for almost a semester now, I realized that I have learned to understand the concepts and found out that if I try doing something, I can achieve it.
