                                 My name is Manogna Namburu, and I am a student at Dublin High School. My goal in life is to major in computer software engineering and have a minor degree in chemical engineering. My interest for computer science came after spending quite some time coding in my computer science class in my freshman year in which I realized that I am interested in learning about how to use different languages to build complex projects in the future. Another main motive behind my interest in software engineering is that both my parents are computer science engineers, and so I hope that someday I would get the chance to follow in their footsteps. My interest in chemical engineering came from the fact that I have always loved chemistry as it is my favorite subject in school. Though I have very little exposure to that field, I have a strong passion for going into that branch.
                                 I am generally seen as a person who works hard to reach her goals and does not give up on the way because the workload is too much. Even at school projects, I am seen to be self-motivated to get the work done on time. I possess characteristics such as being alert at all times, organized and finally I am persistent, once I get engaged in some activity, I do not back out. To pursue my dream of becoming an engineer, I joined the Engineering Academy at my high school after taking a year-long course on the Principle of Computer Engineering. There I was exposed to various languages such as Python, HTML CSS and more. Though at first, it was a challenging class since prior to the class I had no coding experience, but I soon learned to enjoy the class. The following year I took POE, where I faced similar challenges as the year before. I had no experience in the physical aspects of mechanical engineering projects which caused me to worry if I would do well in this class. After doing multiple projects in that class, I adapted to the criteria of that class and was exposed to multiple branches of engineering.  
                                 This year, I am taking AP Computer Science as my elective. So far, I am feeling confident in the class as I am able to handle the workload and understand the concepts being taught to us. Along with AP CSA, I am also taking AP Chemistry. I enjoy both the classes as they are challenging but at the same time are interesting. I am also participating in various on-campus clubs such as CSF, the Enrichment club and the Gael force Build club. Off-campus, I volunteer for virtual tutoring children from low-income households.
